The computers of your favorite discounter are practically because completely set up, but also annoying, because too many advertising programs are installed, which the small tool comfortably disposes of.

Note:
*The development of PC Decrapifier has been discontinued, but can still be downloaded.*

Trial versions are not inherently bad, but preinstalled is not always desirable. If you have a computer with preinstalled programs that you do not need, PC Decrapifier 3.0.1 removes these unwanted programs at the click of a mouse. For security, the tool sets a restore point and then offers you a list of installed additional programs, which you can then remove with a mouse click.

So that you do not have another program on your computer, the tool works without installation and can be used from a USB stick.

The current version is completely rewritten and can now be updated faster with extended program lists.
